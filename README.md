# Walled Garden
![the player](assets/externalAssets/baseIdle.png)
an RPG game about a post-apocalyptic laybrinth. inspired by undertale, kirby, and pokemon *(well not that much really...)*.
made by qkuldo in [python](python.org) with [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce).
## Installation
to install, ensure you have the latest version of python, which you can find [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and pip *(all installations of python 3.4 and up include pip, so you shouldn't really be worried about that.)*.
then, run the following commands, line by line.
```
pip install pygame-ce
```
*(not a lot of commands, but it's all i'll probably ever need.)*
also, run this command if you have pygame and not pygame-ce.
*(you can check this by running `pip list`.)*
`pip uninstall pygame`
simple as that, right?
*(hint: just ignore the .sublime-project and .sublime-workspace files. they're there just because i use sublime text.)*
## Usage
just run the `game.py` file like a normal python file.
`python game.py` is the way to do it, however you can run it in different ways depending on what code editor you're using.
